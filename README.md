## Independent repository

**`tytolabs/umst-ucrs` is the system of record for UCRS** — not a chapter appendix of another paper repo.

| This repo owns | Other repos own |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Thermodynamic P2P clock sync | Material gates → [`umst-manifold`](https://github.com/tytolabs/umst-manifold) |
| Credit ledger + thermodynamic sync gate | Cartridge physics → [`umst-concrete-cartridge`](https://github.com/tytolabs/umst-concrete-cartridge) |
| `UcrsObservedAt` observation stamps | Lean proof catalogs → [`umst-formal`](https://github.com/tytolabs/umst-formal), [`umst-formal-double-slit`](https://github.com/tytolabs/umst-formal-double-slit) |
| Rust library (`umst_ucrs`) consumed by agents | Public site → [`studiotyto-website`](https://github.com/tytolabs/studiotyto-website) |

Cartridges bind UCRS via an optional **`ucrs-provenance`** feature: durable logs (memory rows, gate rejects, promotion records) carry explicit **`stamp_tier`** observation stamps — thermodynamic time, not wall clock alone.

> **Scope box — UCRS is NOT material memory**  
> UCRS provides **constitutional time**, P2P sync economics, and `UcrsObservedAt` stamps on durable logs. It does **not** store mix recipes, hydration outcomes, calibration quality, or agent contribution content. Material knowledge lives in [`umst-concrete-cartridge` `contribution.v1`](https://github.com/tytolabs/umst-concrete-cartridge/blob/main/schemas/contribution.v1.json) research memory — see [`docs/AGENT_MCP.md`](https://github.com/tytolabs/umst-concrete-cartridge/blob/main/docs/AGENT_MCP.md).

## What is UCRS?

**UCRS** = **U**niversal **C**alendar **R**esolution **S**pine.

UCRS is the **frugality-first constitutional time layer** on top of the UMST stack. It gives every AI system (and any human system that wants it) a shared, physics-grounded **now**, while ensuring they never waste more energy than necessary to stay in sync with reality. Clock sync admissibility uses the same **thermodynamic gate** predicate as [`umst-manifold`](https://github.com/tytolabs/umst-manifold) (`gateCheck` in [`umst-formal`](https://github.com/tytolabs/umst-formal) `Gate.lean`), specialized here to desync-energy budgets.

### Simple reminder

> UCRS is a shared, intelligent clock that keeps systems honest about time — they only spend energy when it actually improves their understanding of **now**.

### Core idea in plain terms

- **Atomic clocks** give the most precise physical tick of a second.
- **UCRS** sits above them and does something atomic clocks cannot: it continuously measures how much **temporal noise** or **drift** exists between different calendars, computers, and AI agents.
- It then forces every agent to pay the **minimum thermodynamic cost** (Landauer cost) to correct that drift.
- If the cost is too high, the **thermodynamic gate** rejects the wasteful path.

Every sync message is a **measurement**. Every measurement has a Landauer floor: at least `k_B T ln(2)` joules per bit of phase uncertainty resolved.

### Key technical properties

| Property | Role |
|----------|------|
| **Final coalgebra** | Rigorous model of an ongoing, self-consistent sync process (`ClockCoalgebra.lean`, planned) |
| **Desync energy** `D(t)` | Thermodynamic cost paid because clocks have drifted; bounded by the thermodynamic gate |
| **Offline spine** | Local oscillator + pre-computed spine of known calendar structures for long offline operation |
| **P2P mesh** | Agents gossip timing only when the exchange **reduces** total desync energy (gate-enforced frugality) |
| **Thermodynamic credit** | Accuracy is accounted; high-drift peers pay more; Byzantine behavior collapses credit |
| **Epoch boundaries** | Unix 2038, GPS rollover → safe, zero-cost typed reindexing instead of crashes |
| **Observation stamps** | `UcrsObservedAt`: `phase_entropy_bits`, `ucrs_seq`, `credit_head_bits`, `stamp_tier` on durable logs |

### Where UCRS sits in the constitutional stack

```text
Time layer          → UCRS (frugality-first shared “now”)
Material layer      → UMST manifold (thermodynamic gate)
Geometry layer      → SDF / FREP (MaOS)
Gravity extension   → Volumetric potential gradient (manifold roadmap)
Multi-agent mesh    → Thermodynamic credit system + P2P gossip
```

Everything in this stack is designed so agents pay only the **real physical cost of knowing and acting** — nothing more.

### Multi-agent coordination

- **No free consensus** — every shared reference frame costs energy; credit makes that cost explicit and routes sync toward accurate peers.
- **Byzantine resistance** — lying about phase increases recipients' drift; credit collapses; the network isolates bad actors without a separate BFT protocol.
- **Frugality-first** — sync only when `desyncEnergy` exceeds threshold; eager sync wastes energy; lazy sync accumulates drift; the gate finds the balance.

## MCP session clock

Cartridges with `ucrs-provenance` bind durable logs to thermodynamic time via `UcrsObservedAt`.

| API / env | Role |
|-----------|------|
| [`witness_for_agent`](Rust/src/lib.rs) | `AgentConfig` → `TemporalWitness` for MCP session stamps |
| [`TemporalWitness::stamp`](Rust/src/observation.rs) | Live Tier-2 stamp from clock + credit ledger |
| `UMST_UCRS_WITNESS=live` | Real `TemporalWitness::stamp()` on cartridge ingest |
| `UMST_UCRS_WITNESS=synthetic` | Deterministic monotonic stamps for CI |

Policy: [`Docs/LOGGING_POLICY.md`](Docs/LOGGING_POLICY.md) · Operator env: [`umst-concrete-cartridge` `AGENT_MCP.md`](https://github.com/tytolabs/umst-concrete-cartridge/blob/main/docs/AGENT_MCP.md).

### Gravity ↔ UCRS (scope 0.4)

| Layer | Owner | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| Constitutional time | **UCRS** | `ucrs_seq`, phase entropy, credit head on durable logs |
| Volumetric gravity | **Manifold** (roadmap) | Potential-gradient geometry — not a substitute for UCRS ordering |

UCRS is the **time layer**; gravity is a **geometry extension**. They compose; UCRS is not a fifth thermodynamic gate conjunct.

## What this repo implements

| Layer | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Rust library** | Working | `Rust/src/` — clock, gate, credit, Landauer, RAPL hooks |
| **P2P daemon** | In progress | `Rust/src/p2p.rs`, `Rust/src/bin/p2p.rs` — libp2p sync path |
| **Lean proofs** | Scaffold | `Lean/` — tensor Landauer axioms (`PROOF-STATUS.md`) |
| **Simulations** | Foundation | `Python/sim/` |
| **Property tests** | Scaffold | `Haskell/test/Spec.hs` — 5 QuickCheck stubs |

```bash
cd Rust && cargo test && cargo build --release
cd Python && python -m pytest tests/
./scripts/run_benchmarks.sh   # when configured
```

### crates.io publish (dry-run)

Validate the crate manifest and packaging before publishing:

```bash
cd Rust
cargo publish --dry-run
# Full daemon artifact:
cargo build --release --features daemon
```

The library crate intentionally keeps `default = []` features so downstream consumers (e.g. `umst-concrete-cartridge` `ucrs-provenance`) do not pull libp2p. Enable `p2p` only for mesh daemons.


### P2P daemon (sketch)

```text
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 umst-ucrs daemon                  │
│  Local oscillator → P2P sync → RAPL telemetry     │
│         ↓              ↓              ↓            │
│         thermodynamic gate (desyncEnergy ≤ budget?) │
│         Credit ledger (per-peer accuracy)          │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

See [`CREDIT-SYSTEM.md`](CREDIT-SYSTEM.md) for the credit protocol and optimality sketch.

## MCP session clock

Cartridge MCP agents should bind durable accepts to **thermodynamic time**, not wall clock alone. The recommended session clock is [`TemporalWitness`](Rust/src/observation.rs) via the ergonomic entry point [`witness_for_agent`](Rust/src/lib.rs).

```rust
use umst_ucrs::{witness_for_agent, AgentConfig};

let config = AgentConfig::default();
let mut witness = witness_for_agent(&config);
let stamp = witness.stamp(); // UcrsTier2: ucrs_seq, phase_entropy_bits_q, credit_head_bits_q
```

| API | Role |
|-----|------|
| `witness_for_agent(&AgentConfig)` | Construct a live witness from peer id, drift, temperature |
| `TemporalWitness::stamp()` | Advance uncertainty + emit monotonic `UcrsObservedAt` |
| `TemporalWitness::from_agent` | Same as `witness_for_agent` (explicit constructor) |

**Environment:** `UMST_UCRS_WITNESS=live|synthetic` (default **synthetic** for CI).

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `synthetic` (default) | Deterministic `stamp_tier: Synthetic` — isolated from production merge |
| `live` | `TemporalWitness::stamp()` → `stamp_tier: UcrsTier2` on every accept |

Concrete cartridge: enable `ucrs-provenance` and set `UMST_UCRS_WITNESS=live` so `ProvenanceClock` holds a live witness. See [`umst-concrete-cartridge/docs/AGENT_MCP.md`](https://github.com/tytolabs/umst-concrete-cartridge/blob/main/docs/AGENT_MCP.md).

Logging policy (canonical): [`Docs/LOGGING_POLICY.md`](Docs/LOGGING_POLICY.md). Tier-1 HLC sidecar (never overwrite `ucrs_seq`): [`Docs/HLC_SIDECAR.md`](Docs/HLC_SIDECAR.md).

## Gravity ↔ UCRS (time layer vs manifold gravity)

UCRS and the manifold **gravity extension** solve different problems and must not be conflated:

| Layer | Repo | What it owns |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **Constitutional time** | **umst-ucrs** (this repo) | `ucrs_seq`, phase entropy, credit head — observation stamps on agent/memory logs |
| **Material gate** | [`umst-manifold`](https://github.com/tytolabs/umst-manifold) | Thermodynamic admissibility (`gateCheck`) on mix/state transitions |
| **Gravity extension** | [`umst-manifold`](https://github.com/tytolabs/umst-manifold) (roadmap) | Volumetric potential gradient on geometry — not a clock |

UCRS **stamps** manifold and cartridge durable logs; it does **not** implement gravitational potentials or replace material gates. The gravity extension is a **geometry-layer** roadmap item in the manifold — orthogonal to frugality-first shared **now**.

---

## Relationship to UMST formal work

UCRS **imports** thermodynamic and gate results from sibling formal repos; it does **not** fork or duplicate them.

## Architecture — thermodynamic credit (summary)

```text
  Agent A (low drift)              Agent B (high drift)
  phase: 0.001 rad  ──sync──►      phase: 0.847 rad
  credit: 94                       credit: 12
         │                                  │
         └────── thermodynamic gate ─────────┘
              Landauer cost ∝ H(phase | peer)
              Net credit transfer ∝ information asymmetry
```

**Properties (target theorems):**

1. Total network sync cost = `k_B T ln(2) · ∑_{edges} I(A:B)`
2. Greedy credit routing minimizes total Landauer spend at target accuracy
3. Byzantine peers are detectable via credit collapse
4. Epoch patches are admissible at zero thermodynamic cost
